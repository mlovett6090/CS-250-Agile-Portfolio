 Program Reflection – Essential Questions
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with understanding stakeholder goals and translating them into clear, actionable requirements. In this project, user stories were used to define features from the user’s perspective, ensuring development focused on delivering real value. Each user story included acceptance criteria, which guided implementation and testing. This approach helped break complex requirements into manageable increments and ensured completed features aligned with user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs, and what Agile processes will I use in the future?

I approach program development iteratively, focusing on incremental delivery and continuous feedback. Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives supported adaptability and progress tracking throughout the project. In future development work, I plan to continue using backlog refinement, sprint-based development, and retrospectives to improve quality, manage changing requirements, and reduce project risk.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member requires clear communication, accountability, and collaboration. This project reinforced the importance of participating actively in Scrum events, sharing progress and obstacles, and supporting team goals. Transparency, respect for different roles, and openness to feedback helped foster trust and continuous improvement within the team.
