# CS-250 Agile Scrum Portfolio

This repository contains Agile and Scrum-based coursework completed as part of the
SNHU Computer Science program. Artifacts include sprint reviews, retrospectives,
presentations, and supporting documentation.

Course: CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

Reflections — Essential CS Program Questions
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with listening to stakeholders and translating their goals into clear development tasks. User stories help by capturing these needs from the user’s perspective, using a format like:

As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

This structure keeps the team focused on delivering value and makes it easier to create acceptance criteria and test cases. By using user stories, I was able to break down complex requirements into manageable items, prioritize them in the backlog, and ensure the final increments met user expectations and provided usable features.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach software development iteratively — focusing first on defining clear goals, then building in small increments that can be reviewed and adjusted. Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and backlog refinement help maintain focus, adapt to changing needs, and deliver value continuously.
In future work, I plan to use:

Incremental development with frequent feedback loops

Kanban or Scrum boards for visual task tracking

Regular retrospectives to improve team performance and process quality

These processes help reduce risk, improve communication, and keep projects aligned with real user value.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means more than writing code — it includes communication, accountability, and collaboration. A good team member:

Communicates clearly and proactively

Shares progress and blockers during stand-ups

Helps others when possible

Accepts and gives constructive feedback

Keeps work visible through tools like GitHub or Jira

In Agile teams, transparency and collaboration are key — and every team member contributes to achieving a shared sprint goal.
